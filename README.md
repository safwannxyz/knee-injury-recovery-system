# Knee Injury Recovery Prediction System 🦵🧠
**********************************************
This project is a Machine Learning-based web application that helps users assess and predict knee injury recovery outcomes using medical image inputs. It uses Keras deep learning models with a simple web interface.
--
## 🔧 Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **Keras / TensorFlow**
- **Flask** (or Streamlit if applicable)
- **HTML + CSS** (templates/static)
- **H5 model files** for prediction
---

## 🚀 Features

- Uploads knee injury images via browser
- Uses trained `.h5` deep learning models to predict injury stage
- Provides classification feedback (e.g., Mild, Moderate, Severe)
- Lightweight and beginner-friendly interface
- Designed for educational and diagnostic assistance
